Part 3 of the assigment:
1st Of May 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at the Imola Circuit in Italy. 
To be even more specific i'd like to be a spectator at Ayrton Senna's pit crew on that day at the Imola circuit during Sennas final race.
In case you don't know Ayrton Senna is a Brazillian Formula 1 driver that died at this day as he crashed into a concrete barrier,
which then lead to a lot of controversial saftey regulations which changed Racing (not only F1).
With all of that said, from expirince i can tell that many times such a fail can occur only from a mechanical fault, 
I wish i am wrong but this is why I want to be there and found out what really happend.
